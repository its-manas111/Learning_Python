# EvenOdd is a tech startup. Each employee at the startup is given an employee id which is a unique positive integer. On one warm Sunday evening, 
# five employees of the company come together for a meeting and sit at a circular table:
# The employees follow a strange convention. They will continue the meeting only if the following condition is satisfied.

# The sum of the employee-ids of every pair of adjacent employees at the table must be an even number.

# They are so lazy that they won't move around to satisfy the above condition. If the current seating plan doesn't satisfy the condition, 
# the meeting will be canceled. You are given the employee-id of all five employees. Your task is to decide if the meeting happened or not.

# The input will be five lined, each line containing an integer. The i^{th}i 
# th
# line will have the employee-id of EiEi. The output will be a single line containing one of these two strings: YES or NO.

E1 = int(input())
E2 = int(input())
E3 = int(input())
E4 = int(input())
E5 = int(input())
if (E1%2 == 0 and E2%2 == 0 and E3%2==0 and E4%2==0 and E5%2==0) :
